# Dotfiles

> dotfiles and desktop environment setup

A project with dotfiles and installation script (setup.sh) to install apps, and configure a linux desktop environment based on Debian tailor to my liking.

Colapsable Table of contents (optional)

Introduction

The goal of this project is to have a portable* desktop environment; this project should be able to setup -- install and configure -- the exact same desktop environment on any computer with Debian installed.

One piece of the project is the dotfiles, which are configuration files for applications. They are usual named with a '.' suffix hence the name. Though many configuration files aren't name with the '/' suffix and exists under the directory .config.  you can read more about dotfiles here, here, and here

The other piece of the project is the installation script (setup.sh) that takes care of installing apps, downloading the dotfiles and creating configurations that require super user privileges

*- caveats: Limited to Debain and Debian based Linux

However dotfiles alone are not sufficient
